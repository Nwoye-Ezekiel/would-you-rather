# Project overwiew

The name of this project is **My Reads App** and this app basically shows a functional bookshelf. The first page that opens when launched is the main page, which consists of three shelves which are `Currently reading`, `Read` and `Want to read`.

Books can be moved from one shelf to the other and can also be removed completely or newly added to a shelf with the aid of a dropdown button attached to each book at the bottom right.

You can search for new books by navigating to the search page by clicking on the button that's fixed to the screen at the bottom right with a plus sign on it.

You can search for books but this is limited to specific books and you can see some valid search terms on the search page background text. There are certain features added to make the design more unique such as lightmode/darkmode, books count etc.

**I'll give you the privilege to explore the rest.**
(hint: hover on a book thumbnail to see for yourself)
