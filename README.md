# Project overwiew

This project aims to replicate the would you rather game in a more digitalized form. It is a game where a question is asked and you are to choose which option suits you best. It makes use of a fake database, and as such, created questions after app refresh don't persist, except the already hard coded questions. This app gives a very unique and interactive user interface and it's suitable for just anyone. You start by first authenticating as any of the users that has been provided and after which you can start answering poll questions and creating yours as well. There is a leaderboard page that shows you the current ranking but changes as other users passes the criteria to top the ranks. The rank score is the sum of answered questions and questions created by a particular user. Logging out and switching to different users provides a different data which is based on that chosen user. It is a fun game and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. That being said, Would you rather try this game or would you pass it? Goodluck!
